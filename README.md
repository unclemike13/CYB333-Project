CYB333 End of Course Project
"Website monitoring tool"

The point of this project is to develop a python tool to monitor
a website to ensure it is running as it should.  This is accomplished
through utilizing the server API to access it and perform it's 
monitoring tasks.  If a interruption is found in the service
then the tool will prompt a server restart to handle the 
interruption.  This tool will ensure that the server for the
website is always up and accesible.
